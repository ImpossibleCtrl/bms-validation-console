# BMS Validation Dashboard - User Guide

Place both **index.html** and **demo_data.csv** in your GitHub repo root.

- Demo data auto-loads on page load, showing validation results, a default pivot (Assets by Status), and a Bar chart.
- Disable Demo Data clears it for the session.
- Upload your own CSV/XLSX to run validation and pivots.
